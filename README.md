## 📌 About Me  
I am a **Software Engineer, Research Engineer, and Mentor** with extensive experience designing **real-time pipelines, distributed systems, ML-ready architectures, and backend microservices** across healthcare, aviation, manufacturing, and climate science.

I’m passionate about **guiding young engineers**—from mentoring interns in industry to teaching and shaping **100+ undergraduate students** as a **Teaching Assistant for Software Systems** at Purdue University.

I am currently completing my **Master’s in Computer & Information Science at Purdue University (Jan 2024 – Dec 2025)** and am also **CITI Certified** for ethical research and data handling.

## 📂 Why My GitHub Has Fewer Personal Projects  
I’ve spent most of my time working on **NSF-funded research**, **enterprise backend systems**, and **full-stack production ML pipelines**, which cannot be open-sourced.

I prioritize **real-world engineering** over building toy projects. My primary work involves:

- Real-time remote health monitoring systems  
- Distributed ML inference pipelines  
- Production automation for manufacturing systems  
- High-frequency Airflow ETLs  
- Banking CRM enterprise systems  
- Climate modeling & causal analysis research  

Additionally, as a **Research Assistant**, I focus on ethical and compliant work — supported by my **CITI Research Certifications**.
